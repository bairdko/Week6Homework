# Gifs
###### Assigned: 7/13/18

This is the sixth homework assigned during bootcamp. This was our first introduction to APIs and using JSON data.

#### Mechanics
- Hit the buttons at the top of the screen to get ten gifs on that topic.
- If you click the gif. they play.
- If you click them again, they stop.
- Use the search bar to add more buttons of potential gifs to view.

**Known issues:** None

**Potential Improvements:** Styling, and it should probably load the gifs when you search. Seems like an unnecessary step to have to add the button and then click it. Should happen at once.
